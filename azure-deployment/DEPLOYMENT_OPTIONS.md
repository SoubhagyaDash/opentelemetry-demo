# Deployment Options Summary

## 🎯 Your Current Situation

You have the **complete OpenTelemetry Demo source code repository**. This means you can either:

1. **Deploy the official release** (fast, stable)
2. **Build and deploy your own version** (customizable, slower)

## 📊 Comparison

| Aspect | Official Helm Chart | Build Your Own |
|--------|-------------------|----------------|
| **Speed** | ⚡ Very Fast (5-10 min) | 🐌 Slower (20-30 min) |
| **Complexity** | 🟢 Simple | 🟡 Moderate |
| **Customization** | ❌ None | ✅ Full control |
| **Stability** | ✅ Tested | 🟡 Depends on changes |
| **Build Required** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| **Registry Setup** | ❌ No | ✅ ACR needed |

## 🚀 Recommended Approach

**Start with Option 1 (Official Helm Chart)** to:
- ✅ Get familiar with the application
- ✅ Test your Azure infrastructure
- ✅ Verify EventHub integration works
- ✅ Learn the system before customizing

**Then move to Option 2** when you want to:
- ✅ Make code modifications
- ✅ Add custom features
- ✅ Debug specific issues
- ✅ Develop new functionality

## 🛠️ What I Can Help You With

1. **Deploy Official Version** (Ready now)
   ```powershell
   .\deploy-k8s.ps1
   ```

2. **Build Custom Version** (I can create this)
   ```powershell
   .\build-and-deploy-custom.ps1
   ```

3. **Hybrid Approach** (Build some services, use official others)

## 💡 Quick Start Recommendation

Run this to get started immediately:

```powershell
# 1. Deploy infrastructure (if not done already)
.\deploy.ps1

# 2. Deploy application using official images
.\deploy-k8s.ps1

# 3. Test and explore the application

# 4. Later: Build custom images if needed
.\build-and-deploy-custom.ps1  # (I can create this)
```

This gets you up and running quickly, then you can iterate with custom builds as needed.
